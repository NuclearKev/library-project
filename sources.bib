  abstract = {We propose a new optical encoding method of images for security applications. Theencoded image is obtained by random-phase encoding in both the input and theFourier planes. We analyze the statistical properties of this technique and showthat the encoding converts the input signal to stationary white noise and thatthe reconstruction method is robust.},
